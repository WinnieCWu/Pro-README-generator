# Professional README Generator

## Description

My motivation is to generate a high-quality README file through the command-line, which would enable project creators to devote more time to work on their project. READMEs are essential for other developers and users to know what the app is for, how to install it, how to report issues, and how they can make contributions to imrpve the project.
